# Efficient Dynamic Memory Allocators with Virtual Memory

`Multiheap-fit` and `Virtual Multiheap-fit` are space-saving dynamic
memory allocators with virtual memory.

**This repository is for experimental use, so it may contain some dangerous code.
Use this repository at your own risk.**

## Description

- `Multiheap-fit`, `Virtual Multiheap-fit` : space-saving dynamic memory
  allocators with virtual memory
- `Instruction Counter` : a counter counting number of instructions
  by `ptrace` system call
- `experiments` : numerical experiments for measuring Multiheap-fit
  and Virtual Multiheap-fit performance
